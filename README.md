# Call of duty 4 Single Player Experience Mod

A little mod I made in my free time screwing around with the scripting capabilities in COD4. 

# Current Features
- Pseudo XP/Rank System
- Custom Guns 
- Hitmarkers
- Flashbang Hitmarkers
- Custom cheats
- "Realistic" Friendly Fire
- Weapon Swapper Utility (MP -> SP)


#Current Cheats
- Stock Options
	- Ammo is taken from stockpile
- Self Medication
	- Raygun given when downed. Kill an enemy to revive or die in a short period of time.
- Disable Friendly Fire
	- Disables the mission failure when shooting friendlies

#Realistic Friendly Fire
	- "Essential" Teammates actually die when the friendly fire message appears.
	
# Current Bugs
- Large levels don't load because of the amount of custom weapons. The mod needs to be rebuild with less weapons in order to run those levels.
- Some guns are broken... maybe...
- Raygun cheat doesn't work... sometimes...
- "All Ghillied Up" and "One Shot One Kill" (and big levels) crash with out of memory errors if loading additional weapon files.
